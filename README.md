## About Me

With over **16 years** of experience in Infrastructure Support and Project Design, I've transitioned into the DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering realms, 
embracing the challenges and innovations these domains offer. 
My expertise stretches from traditional Virtualisation and Cloud platforms to modern CI/CD pipelines, 
container orchestration, and IaC (Infrastructure as Code) practices.

Since 2019, I've been a dedicated member of Linux Academy / A Cloud Guru, ensuring I consistently enhance and stay updated with my skills

## What you'll find here?

Originally, my GitHub account was initiated with the intent to script a deployment for a 3-node K8 cluster on VirtualBox VMs using HashiCorp Vagrant. 
This vision has since evolved into projects like [RafK8clstr](https://github.com/kozraf/RafK8clstr), 
which extends beyond just cluster deployment to integrating software like ArgoCD and Jenkins_with_Terraform running as K8 pods and others. 

## 🔭 Projects

- [RafK8clstr](#): **RafK8clstr** offers a streamlined approach to establishing a 3-node Kubernetes cluster enriched with a range of add-ons and features, such as the Metrics Server and NFS shared storage. The project seamlessly integrates Vagrant and VirtualBox for local VM provisioning, and boasts an array of scripts to simplify the setup process. A unique aspect of this project is its "wrapper" (setup.bat file) which not only manages Vagrant but also permits the deployment of various DevOps components from associated repositories - such as Jenkins_with_Terrafform / ArgoCD / Grafana & Prometheus etc.
- [Jenkins with Terraform on Kubernetes](https://github.com/kozraf/Jenkins_with_TF): Deploy Jenkins integrated with Terraform on a Kubernetes cluster.
- [TFstate_secure](#) If you require a Terraform remote backend that utilizes AWS S3 + DynamoDB, look no further! All you need is Jenkins with Terraform installed. If you don't have one, please check out my [Jenkins with Terraform on Kubernetes](https://github.com/kozraf/Jenkins_with_TF) !
- [ArgoCD](https://github.com/kozraf/ArgoCD): This repository focuses on facilitating the setup of ArgoCD on a Kubernetes cluster. ArgoCD, a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes, empowers users to manage Kubernetes resources with git repositories as the primary source of truth. The project offers:
  - **Easy Deployment**: Streamlined setup of ArgoCD.
  - **Helm Integration**: Deployment via the Helm package manager.
  - **Customization**: Inclusive of custom values for tailored deployment.
  - **Isolation**: Dedicated namespace for ArgoCD ensuring enhanced security.
- [Grafana-prometheus](https://github.com/kozraf/Grafana-prometheus) The Grafana-prometheus repository offers tools and configurations to facilitate the deployment of Prometheus and Grafana on a Kubernetes cluster, 
leveraging NFS storage. This combined solution provides a robust monitoring infrastructure, 
ensuring persistent storage for metrics and dashboards. With features like NFS integration and a scalable architecture, 
this deployment is designed for resilience and reliability. 
An automated setup process and defined persistent volumes further enhance the user experience.
- [TellMeJoke Application](https://github.com/kozraf/TellMeJoke): The TellMeJoke application is a little fun project of mine - a web platform built on a three-tiered architecture for K8 and ArgoCD showcase. 
The PresentationTier manages user interactions, the BusinessTier handles joke fetching and processing
and the DatabaseTier ensures a comprehensive repository for joke storage and retrieval.
